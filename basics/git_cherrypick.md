1. you created a master branch and commit
2. then craete branch from master feature1
3. do some changes and commit in feature1
4. checkout to master
5. then you will use git merge feature1 to sink master and feature1
6. another way is using cherry pick
7. similary checkout to master from feraure
8. git cherry-pick commitobjecthash
9. git log
10. commitobjecthash is added into rthe master branch latest commit
11. now both master and feature1 are in sink
Great! You're comparing two different ways to integrate changes from one branch into another in Git: **`merge`** and **`cherry-pick`**. Let's walk through an example to clarify how each works, what the difference is, and when to use them.

## 🔁 `git merge` vs 🔂 `git cherry-pick` — Explained with Example

### ✅ Setup:

```bash
# Step 1: Create a new repo and master branch
git init
touch file.txt
echo "Line 1" > file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit on master"
```

---

### 🚀 Create and modify `feature1`:

```bash
# Step 2: Create feature1 branch
git checkout -b feature1

# Step 3: Make a change in feature1
echo "Feature1 change" >> file.txt
git commit -am "Added feature1 change"
```

Now, `feature1` has 1 commit that `master` does not.

---

## ✅ Method 1: `git merge` — Merge feature1 into master

```bash
# Step 4: Go back to master
git checkout master

# Step 5: Merge
git merge feature1
```

### 🔍 Result:

* `master` now includes the full history of `feature1`.
* You get a **merge commit** (unless fast-forward is possible).
* Useful when you want to preserve history and context.

---

## ✅ Method 2: `git cherry-pick` — Copy a single commit

```bash
# Step 6: Reset to before merge (optional, for testing cherry-pick)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Step 7: Find the commit hash from feature1
git checkout feature1
git log --oneline
# Suppose the commit hash is abc123

# Step 8: Cherry-pick the commit
git checkout master
git cherry-pick abc123
```

### 🔍 Result:

* The **exact change** from feature1 is copied into master.
* You **do NOT bring the history** from feature1.
* You get a **new commit** with a new hash.
* Good for picking **specific commits** without merging everything.

## 📊 Summary:

| Feature                  | `git merge`              | `git cherry-pick`         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Purpose                  | Integrate full branch    | Pick specific commits     |
| Preserves branch history | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No                      |
| Commit hash              | Same                     | New commit with new hash  |
| Use case                 | Sync full feature branch | Pick only one/few commits |
| Merge commits?           | Yes (if non-FF)          | No                        |

---

## ✅ Final State:

In both methods, **`master` ends up with the changes from `feature1`**, but the history is different.

Do you want me to generate a diagram of how the commit history looks in both cases?
