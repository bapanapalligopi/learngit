### 🌐 What is a Git Remote Repository?

A **remote repository** in Git is a **version of your project hosted on the internet or network**, usually on platforms like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**. It lets **multiple people collaborate**, share, and sync changes to the same codebase.

---

## 🧠 Think of it like this:

* Your **local repo** is on your computer.
* The **remote repo** is the shared copy everyone pushes to and pulls from.
