### 🌐 What is a Git Remote Repository?

A remote repository in Git is a version of your project hosted on the internet or network, usually on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It lets multiple people collaborate, share, and sync changes to the same codebase.

---

## 🧠 Think of it like this:

* Your **local repo** is on your computer.
* The **remote repo** is the shared copy everyone pushes to and pulls from.

git remote add origin url
git remote
git remote -v
git  push -u origin URL
-u => upstream 

master=>local branch
origin/master=>remote tracking branches
git branch -r =>remote tracking branches
git branch =>local branches
git branch -a =>active branch
git clone => project download from remote repo and set the local git then set the connection b/w the remote and local

git clone url of ssh or HTTP

git fetch
==========
1. The git clone command downloads all the projects from the remote repo
2. If you wanna get the extra changes on the remote again, do you download?
3. No, you can use git fetch
4. go to main branch where you need to fetch
5. git fetch
6. A new commit will be created from master for fetch in remote branches
7. Always update the remote tracking branches
8. Now check out to local master
9. Now merge

You're on the right track! Let's clarify and walk through exactly how `git fetch` works — what it **does** and **doesn't** do — using a real-world example.

---

## 🔄 What does `git fetch` do?

* It **downloads** changes (commits, branches, tags) from the remote **without merging** them into your local branches.
* It **updates your remote tracking branches**, like `origin/main`, but **doesn’t touch your local branches**, like `main`.

---

## 🧪 Example: `git fetch` in action

### ✅ 1. Clone a repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git
cd repo
```

Now you have:

* Local branch: `main`
* Remote tracking branch: `origin/main`

---

### ✅ 2. Simulate a remote update

Let’s say a teammate has pushed a new commit to GitHub on the `main` branch.

You don’t see it locally yet.

---

### ✅ 3. Run `git fetch`

```bash
git fetch origin
```

What happens:

* Git contacts the remote (`origin`), gets any new commits.
* It updates `origin/main` to point to the latest commit.
* **Your local `main` is still the same**.

You can confirm:

```bash
git log origin/main --oneline  # Shows the latest remote commits
git log main --oneline         # Shows your local commits
```

---

### ✅ 4. Now merge into your local branch

Switch to your local `main` branch (if not already):

```bash
git checkout main
git merge origin/main
```

This merges the changes from the **remote-tracking branch** into your **local branch**.

## 🔁 Summary of Commands:

| Step | Command                 | Purpose                               |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `git fetch origin`      | Fetch changes from remote, no merge   |
| 2    | `git log origin/main`   | See what's new on the remote          |
| 3    | `git checkout main`     | Ensure you're on the branch to update |
| 4    | `git merge origin/main` | Merge the fetched changes             |

---

## 🧠 Key Tip:

> `git pull` = `git fetch` + `git merge`
> If you want to **see before you merge**, use `git fetch`.

=========
git pull

1. call fetch and do merge
2.
